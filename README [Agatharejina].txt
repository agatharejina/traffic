Hi!
I am very excited for participating in Hactoberfest and contributing on your project.
Type localhost:3000 (or any port u use) /login and /sign-up to see the results I've made. 

These are list of the changes that I made:
- Created and moved Home, Login and SignUp to a components folder to improve folder structuring and readability
- Traffic or Traffic Inc. are just the name that I made up for the dummy text. You should replace it with your company name or the app name
- Add a font family called Maven Pro that I imported from Google Fonts.
- Add an image in the Banner component from pexels.com

if there's any problem or question or if you'd like to work with me in the future, please let me know.
Contact me on email, agatharejinas@gmail.com

Thank you!
